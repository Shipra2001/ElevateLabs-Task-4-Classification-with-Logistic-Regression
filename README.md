# Task 4: Classification with Logistic Regression

## Objective
Build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Dataset
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
2. Converted categorical labels to binary.
3. Split data into training and test sets.
4. Standardized features using `StandardScaler`.
5. Trained a `LogisticRegression` model.
6. Evaluated using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - ROC-AUC Score
7. Plotted the ROC curve.
8. Tuned decision threshold.
9. Visualized and explained the sigmoid function.
